Ingrow ( East ) railway station was a small English railway station on the Keighley Queensbury section of the Queensbury Lines which ran between Bradford , Halifax and Keighley via Queensbury . The station served the prosperous industrial district of Keighley and was only a short distance away from the Ingrow ( West ) railway station on the Midland Railway Oxenhope Branch , which is now the preserved Keighley and Worth Valley Railway . To cope with the production from the mills the station had a vast goods yard . The whole station and goods yard site has now been incorporated into the Travis Perkins builders merchants which occupies the site . Just beyond the station was the GN Goods Junction where the GN trains linked with the Oxenhope branch for the last mile into Keighley . Beyond the junction the line continued alongside the Oxenhope Branch before diverging beneath it into the GN goods yard , where , unlike the MR goods yard , all the buildings are intact . In 1957 , two years after closure to passengers , the station area was used in a test on a new type of railway sleeper . British Rail deliberately derailed a driverless locomotive for the test . Press and public alike were not allowed to witness or photograph the event .

Turbulent diffusion is the transport of mass , heat , or momentum within a system due to random and chaotic time dependent motions . It occurs when turbulent fluid systems reach critical conditions in response to shear flow , which results from a combination of steep concentration gradients , density gradients , and high velocities . It occurs much more rapidly than molecular diffusion and is therefore extremely important for problems concerning mixing and transport in systems dealing with combustion , contaminants , dissolved oxygen , and solutions in industry . In these fields , turbulent diffusion acts as an excellent process for quickly reducing the concentrations of a species in a fluid or environment , in cases where this is needed for rapid mixing during processing , or rapid pollutant or contaminant reduction for safety . However , it has been extremely difficult to develop a concrete and fully functional model that can be applied to the diffusion of a species in all turbulent systems due to the inability to characterize both an instantaneous and predicted fluid velocity simultaneously . In turbulent flow , this is a result of several characteristics such as unpredictability , rapid diffusivity , high levels of fluctuating vorticity , and dissipation of kinetic energy .

The P112 is a stand alone 8 bit CPU board . Typically running CP/M or a similar operating system , it provides a Z80182 ( Z80 upgrade ) CPU with up to 1MB of SRAM memory , 32KB of in system programmable flash ROM , serial , parallel and diskette IO , and a realtime clock , in a 3.5 inch drive form factor . Powered solely from 5V , it draws 150mA ( nominal . not including disk drives ) with a 16MHz CPU clock . Clock speeds up to 24.576MHz are possible . The P112 is notable because it was the first of the hobbyist single board computers to reach the production stage . The P112 hobbyist computers were relatively widespread and inspired other hobbyist centered home brew computing projects such as N8VEM home brew computing project . The P112 project still maintains many devoted enthusiasts and has an online repository of software and other information . The P112 computer originated as a commercial product of `` D X Designs Pty Ltd '' of Australia in 1996 . As of August 2016 , Dave Brooks has released the hardware and software components of P112 into the public domain , under the GPL . The PCB layout is available in the original Protel format , and translated into the current Altium Designer 16 format , which many PCB fabricators can accept . The P112 board was last available new in 1996 by Dave Brooks . In late 2004 on the Usenet Newsgroup comp.os.cpm , talk about making another run of P112 boards was discussed . David Griffith decided to produce additional P112 kits with Dave Brooks ' blessing and the assistance of others . In addition Terry Gulczynski makes additional P112 derivative hobbyist home brew computers . Hal Bower was very active in the mid 1990s on the P112 project and the commercial `` Banked/Portable BIOS '' CP/M compatible operating system was sold for the P112 between 1992 and 1999 . It has now been released as open source under the GPL license .

Harold Adams Innis ( November 5 , 1894 November 8 , 1952 ) was a professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and the author of seminal works on Canadian economic history and on media and communication theory . He helped develop the staples thesis which holds that Canada 's culture , political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur , fish , wood , wheat , mined metals and fossil fuels . Innis 's communications writings explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations . After the publication of his book The Fur Trade in Canada ( 1930 ) Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America , especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland . The result was The Cod Fisheries . The History of an International Economy published 10 years after the fur trade study . Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming , natural resource a history that ranges over five hundred years . He begins by citing a report recounting John Cabot 's 1497 voyage to North America that marvels about how `` the sea there is swarming with fish , which can be taken not only with the net but in baskets let down with a stone , so that it sinks in the water . '' This abundance attracted various European nations , but Spain dominated the fishery until the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 . The British then took over with the French and later , American colonists , as their main rivals . Throughout his 590 page study , Innis focuses on the complex inter relationships among economics , culture and technology . He writes , for example , that the English were able to dominate the fishery after developing a method of curing their catches onshore , then transporting the dried fish to Mediterranean countries where there was a demand for a higher protein diet . This combined with consumer preferences for dried fish over cod packed in brine meant higher prices , especially in Catholic countries where the church required the regular consumption of fish . Thus , dried cod sold in Spain allowed England to receive substantial amounts of the precious metals that the Spanish were bringing from their colonies in the New World . `` Cod from Newfoundland was the lever by which she [ England ] wrested her share of the riches of the New World from Spain . '' Innis shows how the cod fishery was interwoven economically with the slave trade and international markets for such other products as sugar , tobacco and rum . He argues that rivalry between the British and the colonists in New England led to the American Revolution . While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes , The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire showing the far reaching effects of one staple product , both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and New England . Biographer , John Watson argues that the book foreshadowed Innis 's later work exploring the relationships between communications technologies and the rise and fall of empires .

Devotional movements refers to various forms of Hinduism in India that co exist with differing doctrines and practices . The history of worship in India is one of hybridisation . In ancient times various regions each had their own local myths and folklore , worshipping their own collection of local spirits and deities . Repeated invasions from the north as well as a vast expansion of trade with the west such as Siraf and with China to the east , brought increased contact with other cultures . India prospered through trade beginning in the days of the Roman Empire . An indicator of the Indian merchants ' importance in Siraf comes from records describing dining plates reserved for them . Over time a process of cultural accommodation occurred and the local pantheons of spirits were merged with the foreign . The origin of the major Hindu deities , Vishnu , Shiva , and the various forms of the female consorts or goddess such as Shakti and Durga and the history of their possible converging or merging is not reliably documented . It is likely that in this way , for example , Vishnu collected his long list of Avatars or bodily manifestations . This accounts for the wide range in their divine powers and their rich and contradictory personalities .

Locality sensitive hashing ( LSH ) reduces the dimensionality of high dimensional data . LSH hashes input items so that similar items map to the same buckets with high probability ( the number of buckets being much smaller than the universe of possible input items ) . LSH differs from conventional and cryptographic hash functions because it aims to maximize the probability of a collision for similar items . Locality sensitive hashing has much in common with data clustering and nearest neighbor search . Hashing based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms generally use one of two main categories of hashing methods . either data independent methods , such as locality sensitive hashing ( LSH ) . or data dependent methods , such as Locality preserving hashing ( LPH ) .

Pierre de Molins or Molaines ( fl . 11901220 ) was an early trouvre . He knew either Gace Brul or the Chastelain de Couci , two of the first generation trouvres . He was probably a member of a landed family of pernay , or possibly of a family resident in and around Noyon . He is probably the local `` Pierre II '' referred to in documents from between 1210 and 1224 . Four songs are attributed to Pierre in the Chansonnier du Roi and the Noailles Chansonnier , and all appear in other chansonniers with different attributions . All the melodies are in bar form . Most unusual are the presence of a melodic tritone in two sources for Fine amours et bone esperance and of a sharpened subdominant in Chanter me fet ce do n't je crien morir , both created by the use of accidentals . Fine amours served as the model for an anonymous composition of the same name ( the second line beginning Me fait ) , an anonymous piece beginning L'autrier par une matinee , and an anonymous song to the Virgin Mary , Douce dame , vierge Marie . The music of Chanter me fet was used in two different readings of Pour la pucele en chantant me deport by Gautier de Coincy and the lyrics were a model for the anonymous Destroiz d'amours et pensis sans deport . The other pieces attributed to Pierre are Quant foillissent li boscage and Tant sai d'amours con cil qui plus l'emprent .

Pierre Joseph Desault ( 6 February 1738 1 June 1795 ) was a French anatomist and surgeon . He was destined for a career in the Church , but his own inclination was towards the study of medicine . after learning something from the barber surgeon of his native village , he was settled as an apprentice in the military hospital of Belfort , where he acquired some knowledge of anatomy and military surgery . Going to Paris at about twenty years of age , he later opened a school of anatomy there in the winter of 1766 , the success of which excited the jealousy of the established teachers and professors , who tried to make him give up his lectures . In 1776 he was admitted as a member of the Corps of Surgeons . and in 1782 he was appointed Surgeon Major to the Hospital of Charity . In 1784 , Desault moved to the Htel Dieu to participate in a major ancien rgime experiments in surgical education . Within a few years he was recognized as one of the leading surgeons of France . The clinical school of surgery which he instituted at the Htel Dieu attracted great numbers of students , not only from every part of France ( Pierre Bouchet from Lyon for example ) but also from other countries . and he frequently had an audience of about 100 . In fact , it was praised by Marie Franois Xavier Bichat as the best surgical school in Europe . Desault introduced many improvements to the practice of surgery , as well as to the construction of surgical instruments . In 1791 he established a Journal de chirurgerie , edited by his pupils , which was a record of the most interesting cases that had occurred in his clinical school , with the remarks which he had made upon them in the course of his lectures . In the midst of his labors , however , he became obnoxious to some of the Revolutionary authorities , and he was , on some frivolous charge , denounced to the government . After being twice examined , he was seized on 28 May 1793 , in the midst of delivering a lecture , carried away from his surgical theatre , and committed to prison in the Luxembourg . In three days , however , he was liberated , and permitted to resume his functions . On 31 May 1795 he was summoned to attend to the young Louis XVII by the latter 's prisonguards , due to his severe illness . Desault died the next day , before he could visit the King . The rumour that his death was caused by poisoning during this summons was disproved by the autopsy carried out by his pupil , Marie Franois Xavier Bichat . A pension was settled on his widow by the Republic .

Zagreb philological school ( Serbo Croatian . Zagrebaka filoloka kola ) was a 19th century philological school that operated in Zagreb , offering a set of solutions for the issues involved in the standardization of Croatian literary language . It was led by Adolfo Veber Tkalevi . In the 1860s it dominated Croatian cultural life , drawing upon linguistic and ideological conceptions advocated by the members of the Illyrian movement . Solutions proposed by the Zagreb school were a combination of traditional orthographic practices , as well as amalgamation of various artificial and dialectal features that would satisfy the needs of most native speakers . Among these are . morphonological orthography ( e.g . sudca `` of judge '' , as opposed to suca ) genitive plural ending ah , which earned them a derisive nickname ahavci ( `` Ahavians '' ) old case endings in the dative , locative and instrumental plural ( e.g . noim , noih , noi ) usage of the letter for the reflexes of Proto Slavic yat sound ( e.g . rnik ) writing er for syllabic /r/ ( e.g . perst ) The most important grammarians of the school were Vjekoslav Babuki , Antun Maurani and Adolfo Veber Tkalevi . On the area of lexicography the Croatized Slovak Bogoslav ulek rose to prominence , particularly in the area of purism where he liberally coined neologisms and borrowed replacement from other Slavic languages for non Slavic loanwords . The young Vatroslav Jagi was a firm supporter of Zagreb school 's ideas , but eventually abandoned them . The Zagreb philological school was dominant over the rival Rijeka Philological School and Zadar Philological School , primarily due to competences of its adherents . It was only with the advent of Croatian Vukovians that Zagreb school started to decline .

A discourse community is a group of people who share a set of discourses , understood as basic values and assumptions , and ways of communicating about those goals . Linguist John Swales defined discourse communities as `` groups that have goals or purposes , and use communication to achieve these goals '' . Some examples of a discourse community might be those who read and/or contribute to a particular academic journal , or members of an email list for Madonna fans . Each discourse community has its own unwritten rules about what can be said and how it can be said . for instance , the journal will not accept an article with the claim that `` Discourse is the coolest concept '' . on the other hand , members of the email list may or may not appreciate a Freudian analysis of Madonna 's latest single . Most people move within and between different discourse communities every day . Since the discourse community itself is intangible , it is easier to imagine discourse communities in terms of the fora in which they operate . The hypothetical journal and email list can each be seen as an example of a forum , or a `` concrete , local manifestation of the operation of the discourse community '' . The term was first used by sociolinguist Martin Nystrand in 1982 , and further developed by American linguist John Swales . Writing about the acquisition of academic writing styles of those who are learning English as an additional language , Swales presents six defining characteristics . A discourse community . has a broadly agreed set of common public goals . has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members . uses its participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback . utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims . in addition to owning genres , it has acquired some specific lexis . has a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise . develops a sense of `` silential relations '' ( Becker 1995 ) develops horizons of expectation James Porter defined the discourse community as . `` a local and temporary constraining system , defined by a body of texts ( or more generally , practices ) that are unified by a common focus . A discourse community is a textual system with stated and unstated conventions , a vital history , mechanisms for wielding power , institutional hierarchies , vested interests , and so on . '' Argumentation theorists Chaim Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts Tyceta offer the following statement on the conditioned nature of all discourse , which has applicability to the concept of discourse community . `` All language is the language of community , be this a community bound by biological ties , or by the practice of a common discipline or technique . The terms used , their meaning , their definition , can only be understood in the context of the habits , ways of thought , methods , external circumstances , and tradition known to the users of those terms . A deviation from usage requires justification ... '' `` Producing text within a discourse community , '' according to Patricia Bizzell , `` can not take place unless the writer can define her goals in terms of the community 's interpretive conventions . '' In other words , one can not simply produce any textit must fit the standards of the discourse community to which it is appealing . If one wants to become a member of a certain discourse community , it requires more than learning the lingo . It requires understanding concepts and expectations set up within that community . The language used by discourse communities can be described as a register or diatype , and members generally join a discourse community through training or personal persuasion . This is in contrast to the speech community ( or the 'native discourse community ' , to use Bizzell 's term ) , who speak a language or dialect inherited by birth or adoption .

Solana Beach , also known as the Solana Beach Transit Center , is a train station on Amtrak California 's Pacific Surfliner passenger train and on North County Transit District 's COASTER commuter rail route located in Solana Beach , California . The tracks were lowered to their current position in the late 90s , to alleviate congestion on Lomas Santa Fe Road and Downtown Solana Beach . There is enough room between the two tracks to create a third track , which could be used as a bypass track . The station was designed by architect Rob Wellington Quigley , and was built in 1994 to replace the depot in Del Mar , California . Funding for the station included $ 2.8 million from Proposition 116 . an additional $ 3.3 million used for land acquisition and design was obtained through Transnet , a half cent county sales tax . Quigley drew inspiration for the design from a group of Quonset huts that used to line North Cedros Avenue in the 1940s . To the basic semi circular form of the hut , the architect added a tower reminiscent of those found on many train depots dating to the second half of the 19th century . In the late 1990s , an $ 18 million project loweredthe tracks and station platforms . This allowed for another track and platform and improved safety by eliminating the railroad crossing located south of the station . Solana Beach and the North County Transit District would like to convert the station and some of the adjacent surface parking into offices , a restaurant and an underground parking structure . This could involve the station being repurposed or demolished with ticket sales and other train services moved to the train track level . The parking garage could complement the Cedros Design District and adjacent Coast highway 101 . Of the 73 California stations served by Amtrak , Solana Beach was the tenth busiest in FY2010 , boarding or detraining an average of approximately 1100 passengers daily .

Special legislation is a legal term of art used in the United States which refers to acts of a state legislature which apply only to part of a classa particular person , thing , or locale within a given class . `` Special legislation '' is also preferred as `` Local legislation '' . In most states , if a general law can be enacted , the legislature may not enact a special law , except a local law . and there are certain subjects on which the legislature can not enact even local law . In some states , whether a law is special is determined by the courts . whether a general law could have been made applicable in is judicially determined without regard to any legislative assertion on that subject . Other states allow the legislature to determine whether a bill is special legislation . In some states , such as Pennsylvania , the state constitution prohibits special legislation . though it is often possible for the legislature to evade this restriction by describing the community in great detail without mentioning its name . ( For example , Pennsylvania law defines certain powers of `` cities of the second class '' , which was originally defined specifically to apply only to Pittsburgh . the lower threshold of this class has been revised downward to accommodate a decline in Pittsburgh 's population , with the effect that other cities not originally envisioned have become entitled to second class status . ) At the opposite end of the spectrum , in some statesparticularly the New England statesthe state legislature has plenary authority over municipalities , and may create or abolish them , or change their governing laws , at will . These states typically have very weak traditions of home rule , such that any significant legal change to a city or town 's charter or governing laws , or an agreement between municipalities , must be authorized by an act of the legislature . There is usually a legal process by which a community may petition the legislature for such a change , and the outcome of this process , if the legislature consents , is special legislation . In the middle are states like Georgia , where the state legislature must charter any new city , but does not have the power to directly change a charter . The city of Sandy Springs , one of the largest in Georgia , languished unincorporated for years despite local efforts due to the politics involved in this method , which prevented the affected people from voting on their own fate . Sandy Springs was finally incorporated in December 2005 . The Georgia General Assembly may also revoke a city charter , as it did en masse in 1995 from every city which did not offer at least three distinct services to its citizens . The term `` special legislation '' may also apply in some states to legislation which names a particular person , as in appointment to a government position or conveyance of real property between an individual and the state , or between an individual and an unincorporated community . Although the Supreme Court has upheld the right of states and Congress to enact special laws , scholars have argued that special legislation is unconstitutional .

The Point Amour Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on Point Amour in southern Labrador , Canada . It is not far from L'Anse Amour , and was completed in 1857 . It is the tallest lighthouse in Atlantic Canada , and the second tallest one in all of Canada , reaching a height of 125 feet . The point amour lighthouse was part of a series of four lighthouses built in the 1850s to allow for safer passage for the increased steamship travel between Europe and the new world at that time . The cylindrical tower is built of limestone and is painted white with a black band . The limestone used for construction of the lighthouse was obtained from local quarries . Other materials such as timber and brick were not as accessible and were shipped from Quebec to L Anse au Loup . From L Anse au Loup they were brought to the sight where the lighthouse was constructed , four miles away . It was built in the series of Imperial Towers and is designated a Provincial Historic Site . The residential part of the lighthouse , completed in 1857 , has been renovated and now serves as a museum . The site was also home to a Marconi Station , of which only the foundations survive . A second order Fresnel lens with a focal plane at 152 feet ( 46 m ) above sea level is in use . In 1996 the operation of the lighthouse was converted to an automatic system . The light characteristic is a period of light of 16 seconds with an adjacent pause of 4 seconds . A fog signal may be sounded from a separate building .
Since their first match in 2009 , 42 players have represented the Afghanistan national cricket team in One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) . A One Day International is an international cricket match between two representative teams , each having ODI status , as determined by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) . An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited , and that each team has only one innings . The Afghanistan Cricket Federation was formed in 1995 , but cricket was banned by the Taliban until 2000 . When the ban was lifted , the team experienced a `` meteoric rise through international cricket '' . They were admitted to the ICC as an affiliate member in 2001 , and in 2006 played and beat the Marylebone Cricket Club in Mumbai . Later in 2006 they toured England , winning six out of seven matches against county second XI teams . They joined the World Cricket League in 2008 , winning Divisions Five and Four in their inaugural years , and the following year won Division Three . In 2009 , Afghanistan narrowly missed out on a place in the 2011 Cricket World Cup , finishing fifth in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier . Their final position earnt them ODI status , and the opportunity to take part in the four day ICC Intercontinental Cup . Their first ODI was the fifth place play off of the 2009 World Cup Qualifier against Scotland , which they won by 89 runs . This list includes all players who have played at least one ODI match and is initially arranged in the order of debut appearance . Where more than one player won their first caps in the same match , those players are initially listed alphabetically at the time of debut .
Pederasty or paederasty ( US . or UK . ) is a ( usually erotic ) homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or adolescent male . The word pederasty derives from Greek ( paiderastia ) `` love of boys '' , a compound derived from ( pais ) `` child , boy '' and ( erasts ) `` lover '' . In French , however , `` pdrastie '' has been used as a synonym for homosexuality between adult males ( see Histoire du mot pdrastie ) . Historically , pederasty has existed as a variety of customs and practices within different cultures . The status of pederasty has changed over the course of history , at times considered an ideal and at other times a crime . In the history of Europe , its most structured cultural manifestation was Athenian pederasty , and became most prominent in the 6th century BC . Greek pederasty 's various forms were the subject of philosophic debates in which the purely carnal type was unfavorably compared with erotic friendships and moderate forms , known as Sophrosyne . The legal status of pederasty in most countries is determined by whether or not the boy has reached the local age of consent , and as to whether such contact is considered abusive to the young person .

Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials , usually metals or thermoplastics , by causing fusion , which is distinct from lower temperature metal joining techniques such as brazing and soldering , which do not melt the base metal . In addition to melting the base metal , a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material ( the weld pool ) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material . Pressure may also be used in conjunction with heat , or by itself , to produce a weld . Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized . Although less common , there are also solid state welding processes such as friction welding or shielded active gas welding in which metal does not melt . Some of the best known welding methods include . Oxy fuel welding also known as oxyacetylene welding or oxy welding , uses fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals . Shielded metal arc welding ( SMAW ) also known as `` stick welding or electric welding '' , uses an electrode that has flux around it to protect the weld puddle . The electrode holder holds the electrode as it slowly melts away . Slag protects the weld puddle from atmospheric contamination . Gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) also known as TIG ( tungsten , inert gas ) , uses a non consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld . The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas such as argon or helium . Gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) commonly termed MIG ( metal , inert gas ) , uses a wire feeding gun that feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon based shielding gas or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) over the weld puddle to protect it from atmospheric contamination . Flux cored arc welding ( FCAW ) almost identical to MIG welding except it uses a special tubular wire filled with flux . it can be used with or without shielding gas , depending on the filler . Submerged arc welding ( SAW ) uses an automatically fed consumable electrode and a blanket of granular fusible flux . The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being `` submerged '' under the flux blanket . Electroslag welding ( ESW ) a highly productive , single pass welding process for thicker materials between 1 inch ( 25 mm ) and 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in a vertical or close to vertical position . Electric resistance welding ( ERW ) a welding process that produces coalescence of laying surfaces where heat to form the weld is generated by the electrical resistance of the material . In general , an efficient method , but limited to relatively thin material . Many different energy sources can be used for welding , including a gas flame , an electric arc , a laser , an electron beam , friction , and ultrasound . While often an industrial process , welding may be performed in many different environments , including in open air , under water , and in outer space . Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns , electric shock , vision damage , inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes , and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation . Until the end of the 19th century , the only welding process was forge welding , which blacksmiths had used for centuries to join iron and steel by heating and hammering . Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first processes to develop late in the century , and electric resistance welding followed soon after . Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods . Following the wars , several modern welding techniques were developed , including manual methods like SMAW , now one of the most popular welding methods , as well as semi automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW , SAW , FCAW and ESW . Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding , electron beam welding , magnetic pulse welding ( MPW ) , and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century . Today , the science continues to advance . Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings , and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality .

The town is well known for its ceramics and this tradition stretches back to the 3rd century BC from when various samples of ceramic work have been found with a very distinctive zig zag pattern.There appear to have been settlements on some small elevations of land in the surrounding areas from the Neolithic Period up until Bronze Age . In the 2nd century BC there appears to have been several different cultures in the region , among them the culture of Argar more commonly found in Almeria ( further south down the coast of Spain ) .The area has always attracted settlers mostly because of its importance in agriculture due largely to the basin being irrigated by the Segura river , though there have often problems as the area is prone to flooding.Redovan s early history is dominated by the Arabs ( Moors ) and there is little doubt that the name of the village is derived from the Arabic language , despite there being some confusion as to the actual origin of the name . Some say that name derives from a famous general of the Moorish King of Granada named Farax Ben Redvan ( or Reduan ) who invaded and plundered the village in 1331 . Others refer to the Book of Distributions in Orihuela which mentions the name Aben Redvan ( of the children of Reduan ) relating to a time much earlier than 1331 . A 16th century historian attributes the name to the family of Redouanes ( of Moroccan origin ) who were Moorish noblemen from Granada.Redovan and the whole area suffered a great pestilence in 1347 and this lasted until 1351 this ravaged the agriculture of the area and many of its residents re settled in the city of Orihuela . During this time the town was often plundered by bandits and renegades . The plague hit again in 1374 and in 1383 . Redovan and its people were also greatly affected by the constant wars between the Kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon.During the 17th Century Redovan enjoyed a period of improved wealth and prosperity due to successes in agriculture , important crops at the time being grapes , vegetables , wheat , olives and the mulberry ( silk became an important product of the town ) .Redovan was seriously damaged by the disastrous earthquake of 1829 and there a great loss of life . In 1847 Redovan had 160 houses and 1,591 inhabitants , its industry consisted of 5 mills and some looms .Modern day Redovan is a busy town of around 5,600 people , it is noted for the production of cotton , hemp and hemp products , espadrilles and the formerly mentioned ceramics . During the latter part of September there is an exhibition of hemp products in the town dedicated to the patron saint of the village , St Michael.It is also a popular location for potholers as there are many caves in the area suitable for this more modern pursuit . Redovan has numerous bars , restaurants and shops , centred on its village square where many celebrations , fiestas and festivities take place.Redovan is readily accessible via the N 340 and the A 7 motorway , it is approximately 52 km from Alicante and its international airport at El Altet ( Alicante ) .

Cetrimonium bromide [ ( C16H33 ) N ( CH3 ) 3 ] Br . cetyltrimethylammonium bromide . hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide . CTAB ] is a quaternary ammonium surfactant . It is one of the components of the topical antiseptic cetrimide . The cetrimonium ( hexadecyltrimethylammonium ) cation is an effective antiseptic agent against bacteria and fungi . It is also one of the main components of some buffers for the extraction of DNA . It has been widely used in synthesis of gold nanoparticles ( e.g. , spheres , rods , bipyramids ) , mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( e.g. , MCM 41 ) , and hair conditioning products . The closely related compounds cetrimonium chloride and cetrimonium stearate are also used as topical antiseptics and may be found in many household products such as shampoos and cosmetics . CTAB , due to its relatively high cost , is typically only used in select cosmetics . As with most surfactants , CTAB forms micelles in aqueous solutions . At 303 K ( 30 C ) it forms micelles with aggregation number 75 120 ( depending on method of determination . average ~95 ) and degree of ionization , = 0.20.1 ( fractional charge . from low to high concentration ) . The binding constant ( K ) of Br counterion to a CTA+ micelle at 303 K ( 30 C ) is ca . 400 M 1 . This value is calculated from Br and CTA+ ion selective electrode measurements and conductometry data by using literature data for micelle size ( r = ~3 nm ) , extrapolated to the critical micelle concentration of 1 mM . However , K varies with total surfactant concentration so it is extrapolated to the point at which micelle concentration is zero .

The Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations ( ERCHO ) was an early homophile organization founded in 1969 . ERCHO had its roots in an earlier organization , 1963 's East Coast Homophile Organizations ( ECHO ) , and was a regional American homophilic organizationa forerunner to the contemporary gay rights movement that flourished after the Stonewall riots . The group was set up by the lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis . After the Stonewall riots in 1969 , a motion was passed by ERCHO to have an annual celebration of the riotsthe origin of current Pride parades . The conference decided to make the event non political rather than radical , a tradition that extends to Pride marches today . ERCHO ( and a number of other similar homophile movements ) collapsed after the rise of radical gay liberationist politics following the Stonewall riots .
`` Disco Lady '' is a 1976 single for Johnnie Taylor that went on to become his biggest hit . It spent four weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and six weeks on the Billboard R & B chart in the U.S . It was also the first single to be certified platinum by the RIAA . ultimately it sold over 2.5 million copies . Billboard ranked it as the No . 3 song for 1976 . The single was Taylor 's first for Columbia Records , where Taylor signed after his long time label , Stax Records , went bankrupt . The song was produced by Taylor 's long time producer , Don Davis . Among the guests on the song were four members of Parliament Funkadelic . bassist Bootsy Collins , keyboardist Bernie Worrell , guitarist Glenn Goins , drummer Jerome Brailey , and Background Vocals by BRANDYE ( Cynthia Douglas , Donna Davis , Pamela Vincent ) and Robert Eaton and Ben . `` Disco Lady '' was the first Hot 100 number one hit with the word `` disco '' in its title , though there had been several disco songs that had already reached number one . The single also reached # 25 on the UK Singles Chart . During the 1980s , the song `` Disco Lady '' was spoofed in a popular PSA for the American Cancer Society in a promotion called `` Draggin ' Lady . '' ( The `` Draggin ' Lady '' in the commercial was played by a teen aged Robin Givens , who turned off all of her peers by her excessive smoking . ) The song is featured in a first season episode of That 70s Show and later Eric repeatedly sings the chorus of the song to appease a drunken Donna .

The Basutoland Congress Party is a pan africanist and left wing political party in Lesotho , led by Ntsukunyane Mphanya . The Basutoland African Congress ( BAC ) was founded in 1952 by Ntsu Mokhehle and Potlako Leballo . The party was renamed the Basutoland Congress Party ( BCP ) in 1957 and retained this name after independence in 1966 , stating that Lesotho was not truly independent . Leballo left the party in 1959 to form the Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa ( PAC ) . The BCP lost the 1965 election but won in 1970 . It was denied power by a military coup in support of the defeated prime minister Leabua Jonathan Molapo . In 1974 , following an unsuccessful rising , the BCP sent 178 men for military training by the PAC in Libya . In 1979 they began a guerrilla war as the Lesotho Liberation Army ( LLA ) . The party won a landslide victory at the 1993 legislative elections , and its leader Ntsu Mokhehle became prime minister . Mokhehle left the party in 1997 with his faction to form the Lesotho Congress for Democracy . The BCP was led by Tseliso Makhakhe , Qhobela Molapo and ( at present ) Ntsukunyane Mphanya . At the last elections for the National Assembly , 25 May 2002 , the party won 2.6 % of the vote and 3 out of 120 seats .
Britannia silver is an alloy of silver containing 11 ounces and 10 pennyweight ( i.e . 11.5 troy ounces ) silver in the pound troy , i.e . 23/24ths , or 95.83 % , by weight silver , the rest usually being copper . This standard was introduced in England by Act of Parliament in 1697 to replace sterling silver ( 92.5 % silver ) as the obligatory standard for items of `` wrought plate '' . The lion passant gardant hallmark denoting sterling was replaced with `` the figure of a woman commonly called Britannia '' , and the leopard 's head mark of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths replaced with a `` lion 's head erased '' . Britannia standard silver was introduced as part of the great recoinage scheme of William III from 1696 , when attempts were made to limit the clipping and melting of sterling silver coinage . A higher standard for wrought plate meant that sterling silver coins could not easily be used as a source of raw material because additional fine silver , which was in short supply at the time , would have to be added to bring the purity of the alloy up to the higher standard . Britannia silver is considerably softer than sterling , and after complaints from the trade , sterling silver was again authorised for use by silversmiths from 1 June 1720 , and thereafter Britannia silver has remained an optional standard for hallmarking in the United Kingdom and Ireland . Since the hallmarking changes of 1 January 1999 , Britannia silver has been denoted by the millesimal fineness hallmark 958 , with the symbol of Britannia being applied optionally . The silver bullion coins of the Royal Mint issued since 1997 , known as `` Britannias '' for their reverse image , were minted in Britannia standard silver until 2012 . Britannia silver should be distinguished from Britannia metal , a pewter like alloy containing no silver .

Anatoly Mykhailovych Samoilenko ( Ukrainian . ) ( born January 2 , 1938 ) is a Ukrainian mathematician , an Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ( since 1995 ) , the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ( since 1988 ) . Anatoly Samoilenko was born in 1938 in the village of Potiivka , Radomyshl district , Zhytomyr region . In 1955 , he entered the Geologic Department at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University . However , the extraordinary gift of Samoilenko for mathematics determined his destiny in its own way , and , instead of a known geologist , science got a prominent mathematician . In 1960 , Samoilenko graduated from the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University with mathematics specialization . At the same time , his first scientific works were published . In 1963 , after the graduation from the postgraduate courses at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR , Samoilenko defended his candidate degree thesis `` Application of Asymptotic Methods to the Investigation of Nonlinear Differential Equations with Irregular Right Hand Side '' and began his work at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR under the supervision of Academician Yu . A. Mitropolskiy . In few years of diligent research work , Samoilenko became one of the leading experts in the qualitative theory of differential equations . In 1967 , based on the results of his research in the theory of multifrequency oscillations , he defended his doctoral degree thesis `` Some Problems of the Theory of Periodic and Quasiperiodic Systems '' , the official opponents of which were V. I. Arnold and D. V. Anosov . In 19651974 , Samoilenko worked as a senior research fellow at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR and gave lectures at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University . In 1974 , he obtained the professor degree . In 1978 , he was elected to become a Corresponding Member of the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR . His monograph brought him worldwide recognition . This monograph was written by Samoilenko together with his teachers , Academicians N. N. Bogolyubov and Mitropolskiy . Thirty six years later , Samoilenko reminisced , `` In Kyiv , at the Institute of Mathematics , great scientists were my teachers ... In many fields of science , they were 'trendsetters ' on the scale of the Soviet Union . It is very important for a young scientist to belong to a serious scientific school . Probably , only in this case he has a chance to obtain results at the world level . The atmosphere of a good scientific school itself stimulates a young scientist to carry out his research work at the cutting edge of modern science . And if he suddenly opens a new direction in science , then his name immediately gains recognition '' . In 19741987 , Samoilenko headed the Chair of Integral and Differential Equations of the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University . These years were marked by especially high scientific activity of the chair . Based on results of the research in the theory of differential equations with delay performed at that time , the monograph of Mitropolskiy , Samoilenko , and D. I. Martynyuk was published . At the same time , Samoilenko , together with his disciple M. O. Perestyuk , published the well known monograph devoted to the theory of impulsive differential equations . These monographs ( especially their English translations ) are frequently cited in scientific literature . Since 1987 , Samoilenko has headed the Department of Ordinary Differential Equations at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR ( at present , the Department of Differential Equations and Theory of Oscillations at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ) , and since 1988 he has been the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine . The beginning of this fruitful creative period was marked by the fundamental monograph devoted to the qualitative theory of invariant manifolds of dynamical systems . This monograph served as a foundation for the construction of the general perturbation theory of invariant tori of nonlinear dynamical systems on a torus . The English version of this monograph is also well known . Three years later , the monograph of Samoilenko ( in coauthorship with Mitropol'skii and V. L. Kulyk ) was published . In this monograph , in particular , the method of Lyapunov functions was used for the investigation of dichotomies in linear differential systems of the general form . The results of many year investigations of constructive methods in the theory of boundary valued problems for ordinary differential equations carried out by Samoilenko together with M. Ronto are presented in monographs . Constructive algorithms for finding solutions of boundary value problems with different classes of multipoint boundary conditions were developed by Samoilenko , V. M. Laptyns'kyi , and K. Kenzhebaev . the obtained results are presented in monograph . Complex classes of resonance boundary value problems whose linear pan can not be described by Fredholm operators of index zero were investigated by Samoilenko , together with O . A. Boichuk and V. F. Zhuravlev , in monographs . The monograph of Samoilenko and Yu . V. Teplins'kyi is devoted to the theory of countable systems of ordinary differential equations . The monographs of Samoilenko and R. I. Petryshyn cover a broad class of qualitative problems in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems on a torus . At present , Samoilenko is the author of about 400 scientific works , including 30 monographs and 15 textbooks , most of which have been translated into foreign languages . His monographs made an important contribution to mathematical science and education . According to MathSciNet , the scientific papers of Samoilenko were cited 336 times by 208 authors . The scientific interests of Samoilenko cover a broad range of important problems in the qualitative theory of differential equations , nonlinear mechanics , and the theory of nonlinear oscillations . His deep results in the theory of multifrequency oscillations , perturbation theory of toroidal manifolds , asymptotic methods of nonlinear mechanics , theory of impulsive systems , theory of differential equations with delay , and theory of boundary value problems were highly appreciated in Ukraine and abroad . Academician Samoilenko is the founder of a scientific school in the theory of multifrequency oscillations and theory of impulsive systems recognized by the international mathematical community . His successful many year guidance of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences furthers the rapid development of mathematics in the Ukraine and the continuation of the best traditions of the world known Bogolyubov Krylov Mitropolskiy Kyiv scientific school . The worldwide recognition of Samoilenko s mathematical results is illustrated by notions well known in the mathematical literature such as the Samoilenko numerical analytic method and the Samoilenko Green function ( the kernel of an integral operator related to the problem of an invariant torus of a dynamical system ) . Samoilenko gives much attention to training scientists of the highest qualification . For many years , he had given lectures at the Shevchenko Kyiv National University and the `` Kyiv Polytechnic Institute '' National Technical University and guided the scientific work of postgraduate and doctoral students . Despite the extremely busy schedule of his work as the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences for about 20 last years ( since 2006 , he has also been the Academician Secretary of the Department of Mathematics at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ) , Samoilenko finds time for organizational and public activities . In particular , Samoilenko is the President of the `` Foundation for Support of the Development of Mathematical Sciences '' All Ukrainian charity organization . Many young talents from the `` small homeland '' of Samoilenko ( Malynshchyna ) are grateful to him for founding and heading the charity foundation for support of the development of gifted children and youth . Samoilenko found and taught many nonordinary scientists . He created an international scientific school in differential equations . Among his disciples , there are 33 doctors and 82 candidates of physical and mathematical sciences , who are now researchers of prestigious scientific institutions , professors , heads of chairs , deans , and rectors ( scientific researchers , pedagogs , and administrators of various levels ) . For example , Samoilenko s alma mater ( the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv National University ) has been headed for many years by his disciples ( Professors M. O. Perestyuk and I. O. Parasyuk ) . Among other well known scientists belonging to Samoilenko s mathematical school , one may mention Professor Kenzhebaev , the rector of the Zhubanov Aktobe University , one of the most reputable universities in Kazakhstan , and Academician M. Ilolov , the President of the Tajik Academy of Sciences . Samoilenko is a member of the Ukrainian Mathematical Society , the American Mathematical Society , and the editorial boards of numerous Ukrainian and foreign mathematical journals , among which there are Differential Equations , Reports of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine , In the world of mathematics , Nonlinear Mathematical Physics , Memoirs on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics , and Miskolc Mathematical Notes .

D. Nuno da Cunha ( c. 1487 March 5 , 1539 ) was a governor of Portuguese possessions in India from 1528 to 1538 . He was the son of Antnia Pais and Tristo da Cunha , the famous Portuguese navigator , admiral and ambassador to Pope Leo X. Nuno da Cunha proved his mettle in battles at Oja and Brava , and at the capture of Panane , under the viceroy Francisco de Almeida . Named by Joo III ninth governor of Portuguese possessions in India , he served from April 1528 to 1538 . On his passage to Goa , he subdued the pirates at Mombassa who had been harassing the coast of Portuguese Mozambique . Mozambique had been brought within the Portuguese trading orbit and provided watering stations essential to Portugal 's lifeline to the west coast of India . Nuno 's brothers Pero Vaz da Cunha and Simo da Cunha were expected to serve under him as second and third in command , a form of nepotism that was expected in the Portuguese Estado da ndia . However , they died on the voyage , and Nuno was forced to rely upon local networks of clientage in Goa during his long rule . In 1529 , Nuno sent an expedition that sacked and burned the city of Damo on the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the Damo River , about 100 miles north of Mumbai in the Muslim state of Gujarat . Forces under his control captured Baxay ( now Vasai , often mistaken for Basra in Iraq ) from the Muslim ruler of Gujarat , Bahadur Shah , on January 20 , 1533 . The next year , renamed Bassein , the city became the capital of the Portuguese province of the North , and the great citadel of black basalt , still standing , was begun . ( It was completed in 1548 . ) Forced to return to Portugal as a result of court intrigues , he was shipwrecked at the Cape of Good Hope and drowned . His first marriage was to Maria da Cunha , and his second marriage was to Isabel da Silveira . The main source for Nuno da Cunha 's career is the Portuguese historian Joo de Barros ( 14961570 ) , famous for his history of the Portuguese in their overseas territories . The work , Asia de Ioam de Barros , dos fectos que os Portuguezes fizeram no descobrimento e conquista dos mares e terras do Oriente , is full of lively detail , with incidents described like the king of Viantana 's killing of the Portuguese ambassadors to Malacca with boiling water and their bodies thrown to dogs .

The office announced a request for proposals with this title on September 28 , 2007 . The lead paragraph of its synopsis describes the program as . Science and engineering research and education are increasingly digital and increasingly data intensive . Digital data are not only the output of research but provide input to new hypotheses , enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation . Therein lies one of the major challenges of this scientific generation . how to develop the new methods , management structures and technologies to manage the diversity , size , and complexity of current and future data sets and data streams . This solicitation addresses that challenge by creating a set of exemplar national and global data research infrastructure organizations ( dubbed DataNet Partners ) that provide unique opportunities to communities of researchers to advance science and/or engineering research and learning . The introduction in the solicitation goes on to say . Chapter 3 ( Data , Data Analysis , and Visualization ) of NSF s Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st century Discovery presents a vision in which science and engineering digital data are routinely deposited in well documented form , are regularly and easily consulted and analyzed by specialists and non specialists alike , are openly accessible while suitably protected , and are reliably preserved. The goal of this solicitation is to catalyze the development of a system of science and engineering data collections that is open , extensible and evolvable . The initial plan called for a $ 100 million initiative . five awards of $ 20 million each over five years with the possibility of continuing funding . Awards were given in two rounds .

Mass analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry ( MIKES ) is a mass spectrometry technique by which mass spectra are obtained from a sector instrument that incorporates at least one magnetic sector plus one electric sector in reverse geometry ( the beam first enters the magnetic sector ) . The accelerating voltage V , and the magnetic field B , are set to select the precursor ions of a particular m/z . The precursor ions then dissociate or react in an electric field free region between the two sectors . The ratio of the kinetic energy to charge of the product ions are analyzed by scanning the electric sector field E. The width of the product ion spectrum peaks is related to the kinetic energy release distribution for the dissociation process .

Stability issues were fixed with underwater stabilisers . Only the first two , Suffren and Inflexible , retain the original design all through their career . the others were converted to steam and sail during their construction .

`` Do n't Let 's Be Beastly To The Germans '' was a satirical , patriotic song popular in Britain in World War II . It was composed by Nol Coward . Although popular when performed live ( British Prime Minister Winston Churchill himself demanded several encores when he first heard it ) the humour did not translate well over the wireless and caused some fuss , leading the BBC to ban the song . The refrain is . Do n't let 's be beastly to the Germans When our victory is ultimately won , It was just those nasty Nazis who persuaded them to fight And their Beethoven and Bach are really far worse than their bite Let 's be meek to them And turn the other cheek to them And try to bring out their latent sense of fun . Let 's give them full air parity And treat the rats with charity , But do n't let 's be beastly to the Hun .

The Persians ( Ancient Greek . , Persai , Latinised as Persae ) is an ancient Greek tragedy written during the Classical period of Ancient Greece by the Greek tragedian Aeschylus . It is the second and only surviving part of a now otherwise lost trilogy that won the first prize at the dramatic competitions in Athens City Dionysia festival in 472 BCE , with Pericles serving as choregos . The first play in the trilogy was called Phineus . it presumably dealt with Jason and the Argonauts ' rescue of King Phineus from the torture that the monstrous harpies inflicted at the behest of Zeus . The subject of the third play , Glaucus , was either a mythical Corinthian king who was devoured by his horses because he angered the goddess Aphrodite ( see Glaucus ( son of Sisyphus ) ) or else a Boeotian farmer who ate a magical herb that transformed him into a sea deity with the gift of prophecy ( see Glaucus ) . In The Persians , Xerxes invites the gods ' enmity for his hubristic expedition against Greece in 480/79 BCE . the focus of the drama is the defeat of Xerxes ' navy at Salamis . Given Aeschylus propensity for writing connected trilogies , the theme of divine retribution may connect the three . Aeschylus himself had fought the Persians at Marathon ( 490 BC ) . He may even have fought at Salamis , just eight years before the play was performed . The satyr play following the trilogy was Prometheus Pyrkaeus , translated as either Prometheus the Fire lighter or Prometheus the Fire kindler , which comically portrayed the titan s theft of fire . Several fragments of Prometheus Pyrkaeus are extant , and according to Plutarch , one of those fragments was a statement by Prometheus warning a satyr who wanted to kiss and embrace the fire that he would `` mourn for his beard '' if he did . Another fragment from Prometheus Pyrkaeus was translated by Herbert Weir Smyth as `` And do thou guard thee well lest a blast strike thy face . for it is sharp , and deadly scorching its hot breaths .

The Baroque ( US . or UK . ) is a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear , easily interpreted detail to produce drama , tension , exuberance , and grandeur in sculpture , painting , architecture , literature , dance , theatre , and music . The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy , and spread to most of Europe . The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Catholic Church , which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent , in response to the Protestant Reformation , that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement . The aristocracy viewed the dramatic style of Baroque art and architecture as a means of impressing visitors by projecting triumph , power , and control . Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts , grand staircases , and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence . However , `` baroque '' has a resonance and application that extend beyond a simple reduction to either a style or period .

The Public High School League of the Metropolitan District , or simply `` Metropolitan League , '' as this conference was informally called , was something of a poor cousin to the New York Interscholastic Athletic Association and the Long Island Interscholastic Athletic League . New York City was much slower than Brooklyn in establishing public high schools , and it was not until the school year of 1896 1897 that the schools of Manhattan Boys ( later renamed De Witt Clinton ) and Bronx Mixed ( later named Cooper , then Morris ) were opened . The league was formed in the spring of 1899 , after four public schools sought admittance into the all private Interscholastic League and were rejected . Undoubtedly the members of the Interscholastic League wanted to keep their organization an all private school one , but there was probably more than a hint of class bias involved as well . The four schoolsManhattan Boys , Bronx Mixed , Jersey City High , and Brooklyn Manual Traininginaugurated the league with a track and field meet and a baseball series . Football , indoor track , handball , and basketball were added to the schedule in subsequent years . In 1900 , Commercial High and Flushing High joined the league . The New York Times , which kept its focus on the private schools in Manhattan , barely gave any coverage to activities of the Metropolitan League . With the formation of the Public Schools Athletic League ( PSAL ) in 1903 , the league continued as a football organization until 1906 , as the PSAL did not initially sponsor football competition . The formation of the PSAL supposedly had its genesis in the shabby nature of the high school leagues that preceded it , but the Metropolitan League represented a bit of reformation in high school sports in the New York area , in that it was the first local league that was under faculty control , at least in theory .

28S ribosomal protein S30 , mitochondrial is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MRPS30 gene . Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion . Mitochondrial ribosomes ( mitoribosomes ) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit . They have an estimated 75 % protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes , where this ratio is reversed . Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA . Among different species , the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence , and sometimes in biochemical properties , which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology . This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that is similar to the chicken pro apoptotic protein p52 . Transcript variants using alternative promoters or polyA sites have been mentioned in the literature but the complete description of these sequences is not available .

Robert Hartwell Fiske was a writer , editor , and publisher of The Vocabula Review , an online journal about the English language , from 1999 until his death in 2016 . He wrote several books about grammar and usage , including To the Point . A Dictionary of Concise Writing ( Norton , 2014 ) , The Dictionary of Unendurable English ( Scribner , 2011 ) , The Dimwit 's Dictionary ( Marion Street Press , 2011 ) , and Elegant English ( Vocabula Communications Company , 2014 ) . The purpose of the site , according to Fiske , was to encourage clear English and to discourage careless English . Among the schools which had bought licenses to the site were Columbia University , Princeton University , and Stanford University . After Fiske 's death of melanoma in 2016 at the age of 68 , essayist Joseph Epstein said that Fiske was `` an unknown soldier in that most glorious and hopeless of wars , that against the ignorant and abusive use of language . '' He stated that Fiske 's linguistic prescriptivism was not well received by contemporary linguists . Reviewing Vocabula Bound , a collection of essays and poems culled from the The Vocabula Review , linguist Alan Kaye said it is `` far too prescriptivist in orientation for a sophisticated linguistic audience '' . In the Canadian newspaper the National Post , a book reviewer said Fiske 's Dictionary of Unendurable English would be enjoyed by `` word snobs and copy editors '' and would benefit those learning English . A book reviewer in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail said that it is `` so passionate in the prescriptivist cause of smiting the lax and the uncaring that the book at times resembles a parody of itself '' .

The World War II British airborne forces consisted of the Parachute Regiment , the Glider Pilot Regiment , the airlanding battalions and from 1944 the Special Air Service Brigade . Their formation followed the success of the German airborne operations , during the Battle of France . The British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops . On 22 June 1940 , No . 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November , re designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion , with a parachute and glider wing . It was 38 men of this battalion who on 10 February 1941 took part in Operation Colossus the first British airborne operation . In September , the battalion was re designated the 1st Parachute Battalion . A request for volunteers for parachute duties provided enough men to form the 2nd , 3rd and 4th Parachute Battalions . The volunteers for glider borne infantry were formed into airlanding battalions from December 1941 . The success of early British airborne operations prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force , setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942 , and creating the Parachute Regiment . The fledgling force received another boost following the German success in the Battle of Crete , when the War Office issued a communiqu . The Airborne Forces of the British Army consists of the parachute troops and glider borne troops of all arms of service . Officers and men in any regiment or corps , may apply for transfer to a parachute or glider borne unit of the Airborne Forces . By the end of the war the British Army had raised seventeen parachute and eight airlanding battalions . These battalions served in seven parachute brigades , three airlanding brigades and three airborne divisions . Some British battalions served in the Far East with Indian Army formations . One Canadian parachute battalion served in a British parachute brigade and a Polish parachute brigade served with a British division . Almost all the battalions played some part in British airborne operations . The first of which was a platoon sized operation in Italy . The second a company parachute landing in France . Building experience all the time these operations were followed by three battalion sized parachute landings in Tunisia . Parachute and airlanding brigades carried out landings in Sicily and the south of France . But the pinnacle of British airborne operations , were three divisional landings at Normandy , Arnhem and the River Rhine crossing in Germany . The British airborne forces were easily identified by their distinctive uniform . The maroon beret , the airborne forces patch of Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus and parachute wings worn on the right shoulder of trained parachutists . On operations , airborne forces wore their own pattern steel helmet instead of the standard British Brodie helmet and after 1942 , the camouflaged Denison smock was issued to airborne forces .

The Briarwood Singers ( aka The Briarwoods ) were a 1960s folk band from Miami , Florida consisting of Stan Beach , Barry Monroe , Harry Scholes , Bob Hoffman and Dorinda Duncan . The band is perhaps best known for performing as the opening act of The Beatles ' February 12 , 1964 concert at Carnegie Hall . In 1963 the group released the album Well , Well , Well on United Artists Records , produced by LeRoy Holmes . The group also released a cover of the traditional folk song , `` He Was a Friend of Mine '' in December 1963 . The `` He Was a Friend of Mine '' single was intended as a lament for the recently assassinated John F. Kennedy and peaked as # 126 on the Billboard singles chart . In July 1963 , prior to becoming a recording act , the group began playing regularly at the Crossway Inn in Miami . The General Manager of the Crossway Inn , Ray Barbarino , had networking connections and expertise as an entertainment manager and promoter . Utilizing these connections , Barbarino brought his friend and colleague , LeRoy Holmes of United Artists Records , down from New York to listen to the band , successfully securing a recording contract for them with the label . During the mid 1960s , the Crossway Inn hosted appearances by many top celebrities and bands , including Peter , Paul and Mary , The Mamas & the Papas , Fats Domino , and Guy Lombardo & his Orchestra . Over the years , several local Miami talents have become national celebrities following appearances at the Crossway Inn , including The Miami Sound Machine ( featuring singer Gloria Estefan ) and the popular Latin singer , Willie Chirino . After signing with United Artists , the Briarwood Singers ' recorded their one and only album , Well , Well , Well which was issued in late 1963 . In early 1964 , Barbarino arranged for the band to be the opening act for The Beatles while working with Jackie Gleason and the Miami Beach Convention Center management team . In the early 1970s , Gabe Kaplan , who at that time was an unknown stand up comedian , repeatedly pestered Barbarino for a job at the Crossway . As he had done with the Briarwood Singers , Barbarino set Kaplan up with his contacts in New York and within a year Kaplan had become a celebrity . It 's possible that the character of Vinnie Barbarino from the U.S. sitcom , Welcome Back , Kotter , played by John Travolta , is a tribute of sorts to Ray Barbarino from Kaplan , who was the show 's star .

Not to be confused with the alveolar clicks . Unicode uses the obsolete description `` alveolar click '' for the palatal click letter . The palatal or palato alveolar clicks are a family of click consonants found only in Africa . The tongue is nearly flat , and is pulled back rather than down as in the postalveolar clicks , making a sharper sound than those consonants . The tongue makes an extremely broad contact across the roof of the mouth , making a determination of their place of articulation difficult , but Ladefoged & Traill ( 1984.18 ) find that the primary place of articulation is the palate , and say that `` there is no doubt that [ ] should be described as a palatal sound '' . The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is , a double barred pipe . An older variant , the double barred esh , , is sometimes seen . This may be combined with a second letter or a diacritic to indicate the manner of articulation , though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks . In the orthographies of individual languages , palatal clicks may be written either with digraphs based on the pipe letter of the IPA , or using the Latin alphabet . Nama and most Saan languages use the former . Conventions for the latter include multigraphs based on in Juhoansi ( 1987 orthography ) and originally in Naro , the latter since changed to tc , and on qc . In the 19th century , v was sometimes used ( see click letters ) . this might be the source of the Doke letter for the voiceless palatal click , , apparently a v over struck with a pipe .

He is said to have reigned for twenty four years . In a rare change from a bald statement of names and years , the king lists provide a tradition linking Nechtan to the foundation of Abernethy . `` So Nectonius the Great , Wirp 's son , the king of all the provinces of the Picts , offered to Saint Brigid , to the day of judgement , Abernethy , with its territories ... Now the cause of the offering was this . Nectonius , living in a life of exile , when his brother Drest expelled him to Ireland , begged Saint Brigid to beseech God for him . And she prayed for him , and said . `` If thou reach thy country , the Lord will have pity on thee . Thou shalt possess in peace the kingdom of the Picts . '' A life of Saint Boite , after whom Monasterboice is named , claims that Boite raised Nechtan from the dead , and associated him with Kirkbuddo in Strathmore . It has been suggested that these traditions should be associated with a later Pictish king , with the very similar name of Nechtan son of Irb . Nothing else can be said of Nechtan with any certainty .

Bertram Charles Binning ( 10 February 1909 in Medicine Hat , Alberta 16 March 1976 in Vancouver , British Columbia ) , popularly known as B. C. Binning , was a leading Canadian artist . In 1949 , when he was teaching at the Vancouver School of Art ( today 's Emily Carr University of Art and Design , ) he was invited by Fred Lasserre , the first director of the School of Architecture at The University of British Columbia ( U.B.C . ) to come and teach art to the architecture students . Binning , from a family of architects himself , taught that art , architecture and life are intimately connected . Binning invited Richard Neutra , one of the leading architects in the Modernism movement in California , to lecture in Vancouver in 1949 and 1953 . He and his culturally aware wife Jessie ( Wyllie ) Binning ( 19062007 ) provided many opportunities in their home for artist , writers and architects to mingle . Bert and Jessie Binning fostered close ties with the most recognized figures in art in Vancouver . They were friends with Lawren Harris and his wife , artist Bess Harris . Those in his academic circle of intimates from art school were Gordon A. Smith and his wife Marion Smith , Orville Fisher , Fred Amess , John Koerner , Jack Shadbolt and his wife Doris Shadbolt , Lionel Thomas , and also Bruno Bobak and his wife Molly Lamb Bobak . It was an exciting time in the world art scene too . The oppressive constraints of Victorian attitudes toward art and architecture were being thrown off . In Europe it was the time of Post Impressionism , Fauvism , Cubism , and the De Stijl movements . In Binning 's personal artistic practice he revealed his lifestyle . Known as an excellent draughtsman , he recorded his experiences in intricate line drawings . a detailed remembrance of an unusual hotel room , studies of peaceful looking female figures , or an architectural drawing of a street in Vancouver . The drawings exude humour and love . a friend cutting a dog 's hair , a picnic view from a high perch , self portraits of self portraits . Innovative and intelligent , his hospitality to students , colleagues and world figures alike made him a well loved professor . The paintings , internationally recognised and exhibited regularly , are composed and formal yet saturated with his leisurely weekends sailing the B.C . Coast with Jessie . The nautical themes and the layered , regal , simple , ship forms portray a unique architectural style . The celebratory touches are often primary colours . The expanses of painted shapes are purely those of the coast he knew best . Binning 's monumental accomplishments on the scene of Vancouver 's art and architecture placed the city on the cultural map internationally . In 1946 he helped to found the Art in Living Group , which in 1949 had a major show , Design for Living , at the Vancouver Art Gallery . In 1954 , works by Binning , along with those of Paul mile Borduas , and Jean Paul Riopelle represented Canada at the Venice Biennale . His visits to Japan and collaborative personality made him an important figure in the negotiations for the Nitobe Garden at U.B.C . He founded and presided over the U.B.C . Festival of the Contemporary Arts , a mold breaking yearly avant garde celebration spanning the decade of the 1960s in Vancouver , at the peak of which Marshall McLuhan spoke in 1964 . Eventually he helped found the Department of Fine Art at U.B.C . and headed it . He presented many papers internationally . was on advisory boards . received innumerable grants , awards , fellowships , one man shows and retrospective exhibitions . He became an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971 . He retired in 1974 . He died in 1976 . In 1997 , the Bauhaus influenced home Binning designed for himself in 1941 in West Vancouver was declared a National Historic Site of Canada . His widow Jessie , surviving him by 3 decades , had lived and managed his legacy there until then . When Jessie died in 2007 at the age of 101 , the ownership and management of the house transferred to TLC The Land Conservancy of British Columbia . The Land Conservancy has made the house available to the public through pre arranged tours and special events . His work continues to be shown regularly in Metro Vancouver lately at the Vancouver Art Gallery , Burnaby Art Gallery and West Vancouver Museum . and is part of The Artists4Kids Trust .

G Khugpa , 'Gos Khug pa Lhas btsas , G Kuk ba hlay dzay , is also written as Khug pa Lhas tsi , or simply 'Gos , was a famous Tibetan monk and translator ( or lotsawa ) of the 11th century . He was born in the town of T nag phu in the province of Tsang . He travelled to India where he studied under 72 religious teachers .

His personal name was Lhas btas ( `` Protected by gods '' ) . His family name was 'Gos but , as his mother and father were both from the 'Gos family , he was often called 'Gos Khug pa ( `` intermarried 'Gos '' ) , He was very critical of the 'Ancient Translation School ' of the Nyingma . In particular , he wrote a long criticism of the Nyingma Guhyagarbha Tantra , as he failed to find any lineage for the tantra in India and thought that it didn t resemble genuine Indian tantras , which led to it being excluded from the Tibetan scriptural canon , the Kangur which was compiled in the 14th century . However , he composed several commentaries on the Yamantaka Tantra and performed the ceremony of Yamantaka according to the Nyingma rites . In the lineage of the Tibetan Panchen Lamas there were considered to be four Indian and three Tibetan incarnations of Amitabha Buddha before Khedrup Gelek Pelzang , who is recognised as the 1st Panchen Lama . The lineage starts with Subhuti , one of the original disciples of Gautama Buddha . G Lotsawa is considered to be the first Tibetan incarnation of Amitabha Buddha in this line .

A dye sublimation printer is a computer printer which uses heat to transfer dye onto materials such as a plastic , card , paper , or fabric . The sublimation name was first applied because the dye was considered to make the transition between the solid and gas states without going through a liquid stage . This understanding of the process was later shown to be incorrect . There is some liquifying of the dye . Since then , the process is sometimes known as dye diffusion , though this has not eliminated the original name . Many consumer and professional dye sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints , ID cards , clothing , and more . These are not to be confused with dye sublimation heat transfer imprinting printers , which use special inks to create transfers designed to be imprinted on textiles , and in which the dyes do indeed sublimate . These are done at lower temperatures but higher pressures , particularly in all over print processes . Some dye sublimation printers use CMYO ( Cyan Magenta Yellow Overcoating ) colors , which differs from the more recognized CMYK colors in that the black is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating . This overcoating ( which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer ) is also stored on the ribbon and is effectively a thin layer which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air , while also rendering the print water resistant . For ID card printing , text and bar codes are necessary , and they are printed by means of an additional black panel on the ( YMCKO ) ribbon . This extra panel works by thermal transfer printing instead of dye diffusion . a whole layer , instead of just some of the dye in the layer , transfers from the ribbon to the substrate at the pixels defined by the thermal head . This overall process is then sometimes called D2T2 ( Dye Diffusion Thermal Transfer ) .

In the mathematical subfields of numerical analysis and mathematical analysis , a trigonometric polynomial is a finite linear combination of functions sin ( nx ) and cos ( nx ) with n taking on the values of one or more natural numbers . The coefficients may be taken as real numbers , for real valued functions . For complex coefficients , there is no difference between such a function and a finite Fourier series . Trigonometric polynomials are widely used , for example in trigonometric interpolation applied to the interpolation of periodic functions . They are used also in the discrete Fourier transform . The term trigonometric polynomial for the real valued case can be seen as using the analogy . the functions sin ( nx ) and cos ( nx ) are similar to the monomial basis for polynomials . In the complex case the trigonometric polynomials are spanned by the positive and negative powers of eix .

It was previously placed in the genus Hepialus and some references still place it there . This moth gets its common name from the variegated pattern of the forewing , in various shades of black , brown and white , which look rather like a map ( although there are plainer forms ) . Unlike most hepialids , the pattern is rather similar in both sexes although the female is usually rather larger with a wingspan of up to 50 mm . The adult flies from May to July ( August in the north of the range ) [ 1 ] and is attracted to light , sometimes strongly so . This species overwinters twice as a larva . This moth is strongly associated with bracken ( Pteridium spp ) and it is most frequently encountered in habitats where this plant occurs ( e.g . moorland , heathland , open woodland ) . However the larva , which is a root feeder , has been recorded on other ferns such as Polystichum , grasses such as red fescue and also on potatoes and probably will feed on a wide range of other plants . ^ The flight season refers to the British Isles . This may vary in other parts of the range .
